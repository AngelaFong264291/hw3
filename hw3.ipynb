It is important because the test set is used to provide an unbiased estimate of how the model will perform on new, unseen data.

Store it in a variable called `best_C`. (Since this question is not autograded, please store the value directly as a number, something like `best_C = 0.001`, if `C = 0.001` is giving you the highest CV score.) Is it different than the default value for the hyperparameter used by `scikit-learn`? \n",
